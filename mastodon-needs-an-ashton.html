Not so much about the addictive qualities of Tiktok and Reels, but mainly about the successor of Twitter/X as the most influential discourse online platform. As someone who used to love Twitter back in the early 2010s, I still remember one of the key moments of this far away era: when Ashton Kutcher disputed with CNN to be the first profile in the world with 1 million followers. It seems like a silly thing nowadays, but back then it was like a huge milestone on a website that pretty much felt like a small club.</p><p></p><p>Being a fan of Ashton or not is not the point. The thing is that having a celebrity of his size so excited about a new<em>ish</em> social network was enough to attract a lot of media for the site and, more so every year, it seemed like the small club was getting bigger and bigger. Network effects, they say, when you want to be where everyone else is. That is the main reason why it seems so hard for newer networks, as much as they could be better for the users (no ads, no algorithm-ranked feeds), to grow onto something more than a niche sub-culture. That's what <a href="https://mastodon.social/">Mastodon</a> feels right now.</p><p></p><p>I have no idea if and when Zuckerberg's Threads join the <a href="https://fediverse.info/">Fediverse</a>, it will have any positive impact on Mastodon, since an open source and community built network will be compatible, for the first time, with a multi-million user Big Tech owned one. But the more I think about it, the more it seems to me that Mastodon actually needs an investment; not the V.C. type, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23658648/mastodon-ceo-twitter-interview-elon-musk-twitter">as his creator makes it clear</a>, but of time and love of a popular big name that uses it like Ashton (<a href="https://twitter.com/aplusk">who hasn't been tweeting since 2020</a>) used Twitter in its early days.</p><p></p><hr class="wp-block-separator"><h6>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@freshvanroot?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash">Rolf van Root</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/an-open-laptop-computer-sitting-on-top-of-a-wooden-floor-UTkRk-DbMm8?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash">Unsplash</a></h6><p></p><footer><div class="content__tag-share"><div class="content__share"></div></div><div class="content__bio"><h3><a href="https://piepiece.github.io/publii/authors/t/" title="t.">t.</a></h3></div></footer></div></div></article><div class="main__right main__right--bottom"></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">Powered by Publii</div></footer></div></div><script defer="defer" src="https://piepiece.github.io/publii/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=1ea8317abae2e05fa2a65ed7bbff7ba7"></script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
